# Reimbursement Project

Full-stack Web development project made in 2 weeks from technologies that I started off unfamiliar with. Allows employee & manager users to log in and manage reimbursement tickets.

## Technologies used, from backend to frontend

- **Amazon AWS RDS**
  
  Used to host the relational database that holds user & reimbursement data.
- **PostgreSQL**
  
  Database management system and dialect of SQL scripting languages. Includes procedural programming via **PL/pgSQL**. Accessed at developer-side using **DBeaver**.
- **JDBC**
  
  Java's back-end database connection and data retrieval API.
- **Maven**
  
  Project structure & dependency manager. Used to manage the local Java project.
- **Apache Tomcat**
  
  Web-server backend framework for Java projects. Uses front-facing Java Http Servlets.
- **Java Servlets**
  
  Java's built-in API for handling HTTP requests and responses. Used for routing to new pages and for returning data packets to the front-end user.
- **JUnit**
  
  Test automation software used for program-internal quality assurance.
- **Jacoco**
  
  Test automation software used to generate testing reports via JUnit.
- **Amazon AWS EC2**
  
  Virtual Linux machines hosted by the Amazon Cloud, used to provide a remote endpoint for the Web application.
- **Jenkins**
  
  Server deployment automation software. Installed onto the Amazon EC2 within its Tomcat runtime in order to build, test and deploy the Web application. I also configured a Github webhook to allow the server to automatically pull in updates whenever they are pushed to this repository.
- **HTML/CSS**

  Standard front-end Web development markup with custom styling.
- **Bootstrap**
  
  Powerful CSS library for clean, classification-managed front-end formatting.
- **JavaScript**
  
  Front-end scripting used for immediate front-end feedback/event handling, custom generation of tables, AJAX/promise data retrieval, and management of custom-populated UI elements via DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Employee Users**
  
  An employee user can log in, add a new reimbursement request, check his or her current reimbursement statuses, and log out using clean, simple, self-explanatory buttons & interfaces.
  
- **Finance Manager Users**
  
  A finance manager can log in as normal, view all reimbursement requests for every user, accept & reject reimbursement requests, and log out using a clean, intuitive UI.
